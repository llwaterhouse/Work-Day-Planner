# Work-Day-Planner
A simple planner where you can enter tasks in areas during the work hours and save them.  They will be reloaded into the corresponding times boxes when you reload the program.

## Description

* In the header area, the current date and and time are displayed and it is updated each minute.

* Time blocks for the workday (0am-5pm) are displayed with a Save button on the side.

* The time blocks are color coded grey for times in the past, coral for the present hour, and green for times in the future.

* The text area turns brighter and the cursor changes when hovering.

* The save button gets larger when hovering.

* When the user enters text and clicks the save button, the text is stored in local storage for that time block.  

* When the program is restarted or refreshed, any stor

* The program is responsive.

* Each minute, the time is checked and if we are into a new hour, the background of the text boxes update.

## Anomalies

* On my local computer I don't get any errors in the console when I load the page.  However, when I uploaded to GitHub, my deployed page gets the following warnings
    * DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb/js/content.js.map: HTTP error: status code 404, net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME

    * DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb/js/intercom-link-expand-loader.js.map: HTTP error: status code 404, net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME

After researching, I found out it has something to do with Chrome adding support for source maps.  To remove this warning, do the following:


    Go to the developer tools (F12 in the browser), and go to Settings.

    Then, look for Sources, and disable the options:

    "Enable JavaScript source maps"
    "Enable CSS source maps"

The warnings then went away on my console
